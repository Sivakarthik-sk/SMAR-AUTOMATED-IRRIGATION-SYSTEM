# SMART-AUTOMATED-IRRIGATION-SYSTEM
This Arduino-based smart irrigation system uses soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and rain sensors to automate watering. Its core logic conserves water by activating a pump only during dry, hot, or arid conditions, and it immediately stops when it rains. An LCD screen and LEDs provide real-time status updates, making it an efficient.
